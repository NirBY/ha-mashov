# Changelog

## [Unreleased]

### Added
- Live dashboard: on Friday the student card and pop-up show Sunday's bag, or Sunday's holiday, instead of only "tomorrow is Shabbat". Schools with Saturday lessons still see Saturday.

### Changed
- Reorganized both READMEs: Installation followed by Configuration; schedules, data selection, mailbox and entities grouped under Options. Verified feature coverage against the integration code.
- Moved services, automation blueprints and dashboard instructions to dedicated linked guides with visual examples; added a fictional-data preview rendered from the paged timetable template.
- Removed unrelated notification forwarding guidance and linked the actual MIT license.
- Removed the duplicate Data to fetch subsection under Configuration; consolidated selection instructions under the main section and moved the YAML example to Services.
- Combined Available data and its table caption under one Data to fetch section in both READMEs.
- Release screenshots now show only the current native inline schedule form; removed outdated standalone and multi-step editor previews.
- Shortened Available data in both READMEs to six groups covering all 18 data types, labeled Data to fetch — v1.1.0.
- Removed README screenshots and inline release history; linked the standalone Changelog instead.
- Restored English screenshots in the v1.1.0 release description with verified absolute image URLs.

### Fixed
- Live dashboard: the student pop-up's timetable renders as a table again instead of raw `|` text. Pipes and line breaks in timetable and homework cells no longer break rows, and a school day with no lessons shows a message instead of an empty table.
- Tag-triggered release automation preserves an existing release description, preventing manually added screenshots from being overwritten. Explicit workflow dispatch can still update release notes.

## [1.1.0] - 2026-10-08

### Added
- Student-specific General and per-resource schedules, keyed by stable student ID. The editor retains drafts across students and saves all student schedules together. Due timers request only the appropriate student/resource pairs, preserving sibling data, timestamps and failure flags. Existing account schedules remain inherited; holidays and mailbox retain school/account scope.
- Hub registration uses the same interactive General/per-data editor, with one Submit creating the hub and all schedules together. Registration and editing share native labels and validation messages in all five supported languages; language changes preserve drafts and Hebrew/Arabic use RTL layout.
- Interactive admin schedule editor with General and all data types in one screen. Controls update on selection, drafts survive switching types, and one Submit atomically saves the whole schedule map. Setup and Configure embed the editor directly in Refresh schedules; stale drafts are rejected if settings changed elsewhere.
- Compact native sections for data, refresh schedules, account and advanced options. The schedule table and accessible ⓘ instructions start collapsed; validation opens the affected section.
- Optional per-data daily, weekly or interval schedules, with all 18 categories visible in setup/options overviews and a reusable editor. No overrides means the previous shared schedule remains in effect.
- The editor first asks for the schedule mode, then shows only its relevant controls. Overview labels follow the signed-in HA user's language, and calendars expose their effective schedule too.
- Selective, serialized refreshes retain other datasets and their last-successful timestamps, batch identical schedules and never fetch disabled categories. Manual and initial warm-up refreshes still fetch all selected data.
- A single FIFO queue serializes refresh jobs across every hub, including manual and scheduled refreshes. Unload drains active work and prevents queued jobs from reopening a closed client.
- `mashov.set_options` accepts a validated `data_schedules` map; `{}` resets shared inheritance. Schedule-only changes reschedule without re-authentication or changing entity IDs.

### Fixed
- Discard draft reloads current server settings and revision after a restored draft conflicts with changed settings, without requiring a page reload.
- Declare panel_custom as an optional dependency and omit account option values from debug schema logs.
- Standalone schedule drafts survive navigation within Home Assistant and reconnect their leave warning on return.
- Hub shutdown waits only for its own active request. Background roster timer rebuilds ignore removed or replaced hubs.
- Cached startup data remains marked stale after login, password-change or network failures. Successful groups do not reset the notification counter while other groups are failing, and never-fetched sources do not inherit a misleading last-update timestamp.
- Mailbox `items` (subjects, senders and message bodies) are excluded from new Recorder history automatically. Live sensor attributes, the integration cache and existing history remain available.
- Closed sessions during account mailbox fetches are operational fetch failures; unrelated runtime errors remain reportable.
- Noticeboard announcements allow the configured timeout for slow playback startup before waiting for playback to finish and restoring volume.

### Documentation
- Separate English and Hebrew READMEs with language navigation, setup guidance and mailbox access/retention warnings.
- Setup and options forms warn in all five supported languages that an empty selection creates no school-data sensors.
- Noticeboard blueprint description uses Data to fetch and explains the actual new-hub and v1.0.15 defaults.

## [1.0.17] - 2026-10-06

### Fixed
- Opting out removes disabled datasets and message bodies from the disk cache before login, even when refresh/authentication fails. Reducing the inbox limit also trims the restored cache.
- Removing Mailbox in Configure resets a previously checked full-content option without blocking the submission. Re-enabling Mailbox starts with headers only.
- Validation errors retain submitted data selections. Holidays has a meaningful category label in all five languages.

### Documentation
- Front-page table lists every dataset, initial and upgrade defaults, with a red full-content read-status warning.
- Step-by-step setup and upgrade instructions include actual Home Assistant screenshots. Documents opt-out behavior, cache retention, Recorder history and backup boundaries.

## [1.0.16] - 2026-10-06

### Added
- Opt-in account mailbox sensor with unread count, bounded recent inbox headers and a separate full-content option, off by default. Full-content fetching marks conversations read in Mashov; both setup and Configure explain this side effect.
- Individual lessons (`specialHoursLessons`) as an optional student source. The live endpoint was reachable but empty in the tested account.

### Changed
- Every dataset, including core sensors and holidays/calendar, can be selected independently. New hubs start with no datasets selected.
- Existing installations (including v1.0.7 onward) retain their core data, optional choices, entity IDs and user customizations. Deselecting data disables its entities without deleting their registry entries/history. Legacy `additional_data` service calls remain supported.
- Selection changes refresh immediately, filter disabled data from restored caches, and never probe an unselected timetable for session validation.
- Mailbox bodies are plain text, attribute storage is bounded with visible truncation flags, and diagnostics export only technical statuses. Attachments are not downloaded.

## [1.0.15] - 2026-10-06

### Added
- Blueprint `mashov_noticeboard_announce.yaml`: notifies about new noticeboard notices and can read them aloud in Hebrew. Quiet hours (22:00–07:00) are built in; notices are never re-announced after a restart or outage.
- New hubs start with the Noticeboard enabled. Existing hubs keep their current selection.

### Fixed
- Noticeboard speech restores the speaker volume even when TTS fails, and rechecks quiet hours immediately before starting speech after speaker preparation.
- A re-login during a refresh could pair one child's data with another child (when the order of children changed) or fail the refresh with `IndexError` (when a child was added). Each refresh now uses one fixed student list; a changed list applies on the next refresh.

### Documentation
- README explains exactly how to enable additional student data, what each type contains, and in which version each change arrived.
- Device-removal regression tests support Home Assistant's newer single-owner device registry without accessing its deprecated multi-entry property.

## [1.0.14] - 2026-09-26

Changes since v1.0.13, reviewed against the implementation.

### Added: Mashov Live dashboard
- New admin-only `mashov.create_live_dashboard` action, with an optional response reporting the dashboard path, student count and Bubble Card detection.
- New script blueprint at `blueprints/script/mashov/mashov_live_dashboard.yaml`. It discovers students across all loaded hubs using registry IDs, including renamed entities. The four blueprint customization slots do not limit the number of discovered children; direct service calls accept more customizations.
- Hebrew/RTL dashboard with greeting, holiday countdown, refresh button, student photos, tomorrow's timetable summary, homework/behavior/grades/notice indicators and per-student popups with school calendars.
- Optional person/family/viewer selection, labels, emoji, accent colors and sensor overrides. Card visibility uses HA users linked to persons; it is a presentation filter, not entity access control.
- Requires Bubble Card 3.4+ and an existing UI-managed dashboard. The service writes the dashboard configuration; it does not create the dashboard container or install Bubble Card. New students appear after running the service again.
- Empty or previously Mashov-generated dashboards can be regenerated. Other content and built-in dashboards require explicit `overwrite: true`. Regenerating a Mashov-generated dashboard replaces its configuration, including later manual edits.

### Integration fixes
- Turning off Automatic school year now saves the selected/current year for hubs that never stored one, preventing an unintended rollover on the next school year.
- Authentication and password-change errors from holiday fetching propagate to the existing recovery notifications instead of being reduced to a generic holiday-fetch failure.
- A closed HTTP session is treated as an operational request failure; other RuntimeErrors still remain internal errors eligible for a reviewed bug report.
- Optional-resource sensor registrations are removed when their resources are deselected, after a successful fresh-roster refresh. Cached, stale or failed refreshes do not trigger this cleanup.
- Core and holiday `last_update` timestamps now use HA's configured timezone with a UTC offset and second precision. Optional-resource sensors also expose `last_update`.

### Fixes made during release review
- Scope student popup links to both hub and student, preventing collisions when two hubs include the same student ID.
- Reject a requested family visibility selection when none of its persons resolves to a HA user, instead of saving unrestricted manual cards.
- Add regression coverage for both cases, existing-dashboard preservation and school-year persistence across rollover.
- Declare Lovelace as an optional startup-order dependency, as required by hassfest for the new dashboard service.

### Examples, translations and maintenance
- Homework/behavior cards consume structured `items`, retain a legacy fallback, escape HTML and handle hyphens in subject names.
- Correct Lovelace install paths and UI-dashboard instructions, refresh-button `perform-action` syntax and weekly-plan examples.
- Add new-service translations in English, Hebrew, Arabic, Russian and Ukrainian, plus desktop/mobile dashboard illustrations.
- Release helper synchronizes `reporting.py` with VERSION/manifest and uses UTF-8 on Windows.
- Expand code/test documentation; comments alone do not change runtime behavior.

### Upgrade and compatibility
Update through HACS and restart HA. Existing entity IDs, settings, holiday school names and notification destinations are preserved. Dashboard creation is opt-in; installing this version does not overwrite dashboards. Templates that compare `last_update` as a raw UTC string should parse it as a timezone-aware timestamp instead.

Validation: full regression suite, Ruff, CI on Python 3.13/3.14, hassfest and HACS checks before release. Existing dashboard screenshots are examples; card visibility is not a security boundary.

## [1.0.13] - 2026-09-26

Holiday devices and their sensor/calendar display names now include the school hub title, so holidays from different schools can be distinguished in Home Assistant.

- Apply the school label consistently to both holiday platforms, including existing installations after restart.
- Preserve device identifiers, entity IDs, unique IDs, history and user-defined names.
- Update through HACS and restart Home Assistant.

Validation: existing regression suite, Ruff, Python 3.13/3.14 CI, hassfest and HACS validation.

## [1.0.12] - 2026-09-26

Fix departed-student device removal and document old-data retention.

### Fixed
- Enable the Home Assistant device-page Delete action for a student absent from that hub's latest known roster, including after startup from cache.
- Complete automatic departed-student cleanup by removing empty device cards after a successful refresh with a roster obtained through a fresh login. Cached sessions, empty rosters and failed/stale refreshes do not trigger automatic deletion.
- Support both legacy shared devices and newer HA devices scoped to one hub. Detach only the affected hub; active students and holiday devices remain protected.

### Data retention and compatibility
- Device removal does not purge HA Recorder history or delete anything from Mashov's servers.
- Successful refreshes replace the local data snapshot; failed refreshes retain the last successful snapshot. Deleting a hub removes its local cache and saved authentication.
- Students still returned by a pinned previous school year cannot be removed individually through this action. Enable Automatic school year first, or delete the obsolete school hub when it is no longer needed.
- README now explains the scope of date windows, attribute limits, cache cleanup and Recorder retention.
- Existing active entity IDs, settings, notification routing and history remain unchanged. Update through HACS and restart Home Assistant.

### Validation
- 146 local regression tests pass, including manual removal, missing-cache safety, automatic cleanup guards and shared-device preservation.
- Ruff and the CI Python 3.13/3.14, hassfest and HACS checks are required before release.

## [1.0.11] - 2026-09-26

Restrict bug-report links to internal errors and add optional sanitized technical logs.

### Fixed
- Remove bug-report links from password-change requests, authentication failures, school permissions, timeouts, network errors, HTTP/server failures and invalid API responses.
- Offer reporting for detected internal programming exceptions, including when HA wraps the original exception during startup. Classification does not establish the root cause; the user still reviews and submits the report.
- Preserve programming exceptions from the core API request path instead of disguising them as network failures.
- Notify once on the first internal failure, even when cached data exists; reset suppression after recovery. Operational-error thresholds and cache behavior remain unchanged.

### Added
- Two choices in internal-error notifications: report without logs, or pre-fill the latest sanitized technical event.
- Technical logs include timestamps, standard exception types and integration source filenames/line numbers. Exception text, absolute paths, locals, credentials and student records are excluded.
- Downloadable HA diagnostics includes up to 20 technical events per hub from the current HA session. Removing the hub deletes this history; restarting HA clears it.
- Optional log-file attachment field in the GitHub issue form, with instructions for attaching diagnostics or manually reviewed/redacted HA logs. No automatic GitHub submission or raw-log upload.
- Compact report URLs fit within the existing Telegram/GreenAPI notification forwarding limit.

### Upgrade and validation
- Update through HACS and restart HA. Existing entity IDs, settings, data attributes and notification recipients are preserved.
- README and issue-report instructions updated.
- Regression coverage checks operational-versus-internal classification, wrapped startup errors, notification suppression/recovery, log privacy, per-hub isolation, bounded history and report-link size. Existing regression tests, Ruff, hassfest and HACS validation also run before release.

## [1.0.10] - 2026-09-26

Arabic, Russian and Ukrainian UI support, fixes from the live-installation review,
and cleanup of accidentally tracked working files.

### Added
- Arabic (`ar`), Russian (`ru`) and Ukrainian (`uk`) translations for setup/options, entity names, weekdays, schedule selectors and service labels, alongside English and Hebrew.
- An **Automatic school year** option for legacy hubs with a pinned year. Enable it explicitly to switch to September 1 rollover.
- Core-resource and holiday status diagnostics, plus visible `data_stale` and actual last successful refresh timestamps.

### Fixed
- Use each entity's registered device ID for compatibility with current Home Assistant device registries.
- Remove repeated student/device names without renaming existing entity IDs or user-defined names; update device/student names after class changes.
- Keep cached sensor/calendar data visible after startup and periodic refresh failures. Mark it stale instead of claiming a new successful refresh.
- Isolate holiday fetch failures from student data; retry holiday authentication once and retain previous holidays when available.
- Expose failed/blocked core and optional resources as `unknown` with `source_status`, rather than misleading zero counts or hidden error attributes. Optional 403/404 responses now log a warning while retaining the 24-hour cooldown.
- Remove departed-student sensor registrations only after a real login and successful refresh with a nonempty roster; never delete from cached, empty or failed rosters. Add newly returned students dynamically.
- Accept `HH:MM:SS`, optional-resource selections and item limits in `mashov.set_options`; ignore obsolete unknown fields while validating known settings.
- Avoid unique-ID collisions when changing a password on duplicate legacy hubs; reject username changes that would duplicate an account.
- Do not restore empty auth caches or year-only session metadata. Delete the hub's cache and issue notification when the hub is removed.
- Render dated weekly plans as date-labelled HTML tables, preserving multiple weeks; use safe date parsing and escape table content.
- Reduce transient-network alert noise: with cached data, create one persistent notification on the third consecutive failed refresh. Authentication/no-cache errors remain immediate; recovery resets the counter.

### Compatibility and upgrade
- Upgrade in HACS and restart Home Assistant. Existing accounts, active entity IDs, raw item schemas, selected options and dashboard references are retained.
- Failed resource states intentionally change to `unknown`; successful empty results remain `0`. Automations that test only for `unavailable` should also check `unknown` or `source_status`.
- Existing explicitly configured years remain pinned until **Automatic school year** is enabled. Per-hub holiday entities remain separate to preserve dashboard references and independent hub removal.
- Legacy `set_options` calls without `entry_id` still target the first loaded hub and now warn when ambiguous. `refresh_now` without `entry_id` still refreshes every hub.
- Portal content and existing Hebrew formatted summaries/cards/speech blueprints are unchanged; the new UI translations do not translate school-provided text.
- Recorder history is not purged when an obsolete registry entry is removed. Rollback before the v1.0.9 unique-ID migration requires a matching HA backup.
- Minimum Home Assistant version remains 2025.3.

### Repository cleanup
- Removed accidental Git output (`tatus`), the working brands ZIP, a duplicate icon outside the integration, and the unused coordinator placeholder.
- Expanded `.gitignore` for scratch scripts, packaging artifacts and local HA access/diagnostic files. Kept the actual integration icon and coordinator implementation.

### Validation
- 111 Home Assistant regression tests, Ruff lint/format, and GitHub CI (Python 3.13/3.14, hassfest and HACS).
- Real HA test entities cover translated names, visible blocked-source attributes, cache fallback, name updates, conservative orphan cleanup and upgrade/reload ID preservation.
- [All 17 review findings and decisions](https://github.com/NirBY/ha-mashov/blob/v1.0.10/docs/review-v1.0.10.md).

## [1.0.9] - 2026-09-26

Reliability fixes and compatibility improvements for existing installations.

### Fixed
- Remove blocking version-file reads during setup by using Home Assistant's loaded integration metadata (issue #8).
- Back off core endpoints returning a school-disabled HTTP 403 for 1 hour, then 6 hours, then 24 hours. Cooldowns are isolated per student/resource, reset on success, and do not suppress password-change errors (issue #8).
- Retry transient startup failures automatically; retain cached data when available. Close validation sessions on failed authentication and preserve a loaded entry if platform unloading fails.
- Keep the selected school during account setup, prevent duplicate accounts including legacy entries, and apply credential/options changes with a single reload.
- Scope core sensor unique IDs to each hub to prevent collisions when both parents see the same student. Migrate registered entities in place, preserving entity IDs and their history references.
- Follow students by stable ID after a class/slug change. Automatically log in for the new school year when the year is not explicitly pinned; reject known previous-year cached sessions and clear old cooldowns.
- Resolve weekly-plan subject/teacher labels from timetable groups and include plan text in grouped views. Avoid rendering an empty grid for dated plans.
- Parse holiday timestamps with timezone offsets and use Home Assistant's timezone for displayed update/schedule times.
- Target set_options explicitly with entry_id, validate service inputs, and correctly apply the legacy schedule_day field after migration to schedule_days.

### Upgrade compatibility
- Existing accounts, options, caches, entity IDs, dashboards, and automations are retained; no remove/re-add or manual migration is required.
- Calls to refresh_now without entry_id still refresh all hubs. Legacy set_options calls without entry_id continue to target the first loaded hub; specify entry_id to select another hub.
- Existing attribute keys and item structures are retained. Weekly-plan subject/teacher fields are additive, display text is improved, and timestamps now include the configured timezone offset.
- An explicitly configured school year remains pinned. The minimum Home Assistant version remains 2025.3.
- Restart Home Assistant after installation. Entity-registry unique IDs are migrated forward; rolling back does not automatically reverse that migration.

### Validation
- Regression coverage includes 403 backoff/recovery/isolation, password-change handling, setup retries/cache fallback, account flows, school-year rollover, holiday parsing, complete attribute budgets, and upgrade/reload entity-ID preservation.
- Release checks include Ruff, the full test suite, and GitHub CI on Python 3.13 and 3.14.

## [1.0.8] - 2026-09-25

### Fixed
- Enforce the recorder size budget on the complete sensor attribute payload, including formatted HTML and duplicated groups. Preserve raw items before duplicate presentation data; expose truncation flags.
- Permit zero stored items when a single record exceeds the budget, while preserving total counts and coordinator data.
- Restore cached sessions using the authenticated timetable endpoint instead of the obsolete /me route. Consume cached auth once and invalidate it when credentials change.

### Verified
- v1.0.7 live checks confirmed both school hubs, current holidays and all nine optional endpoints; periodic grades are denied by school permissions.
- Added regression coverage for oversized Hebrew records, formatted fields and authenticated session restoration.

## [1.0.7] - 2026-09-25

### Added
- Nine opt-in read-only portal resources with per-school permissions, bounded attributes and backoff.
- GitHub report links in HA issue notifications, prefilled with a privacy-safe technical event summary and versions.
- Allowlisted diagnostics and regression tests for privacy and failed refreshes.
- Updated per-school holiday card examples and local HTML capture guidance.

### Fixed
- Explicit coordinator config entry, async scheduled callbacks, local weekdays, option reloads and cache persistence.
- Disable coordinator polling for daily/weekly schedules instead of retaining a 24-hour fallback.
- Bound 401 retries and propagate core server/network and holiday-fetch failures without erasing data.
- Remove deliberate logging of authentication headers, tokens, full responses and usernames.
- Correct stable release notes and replace the retired asset-upload action with GitHub CLI.

### Changed
- Minimum HA 2025.3; required CI coverage for Python 3.13 and 3.14.
- Use synthetic test identities and ignore private local captures; preserve redacted screenshots.
- Existing timetable entity IDs remain stable; dashboards must select their own school's holiday sensor.

## [1.0.6] - 2026-05-01

### Added
- Added persistent Home Assistant issue notifications for Mashov authentication and refresh failures
- Added a dedicated password-change-required flow with a direct Mashov login link in the notification
- Added a privacy disclaimer to the README and GitHub bug-report template reminding reporters to redact personal and sensitive data before sharing logs, screenshots, or diagnostics
- Added regression coverage for password-change handling, credential updates, cached-data fallback, and generic authentication failures

### Changed
- Updated the GitHub Actions workflow to newer action versions and expanded CI coverage to Python 3.11, 3.12, 3.13, and 3.14
- Clarified in the README that updating credentials from the Configure flow only updates the specific Mashov hub entry you opened and does not automatically sync other hubs

### Fixed
- Added support for updating Mashov username and password directly from the integration Configure flow after a password-change-required error
- Keep the last successful Mashov data available when authentication fails and cached data is already available
- Added a clearer authentication notification with a Configure hint and Mashov login link for credential-related failures

## [1.0.6-beta.3] - 2026-04-18 (Pre-release)

### Changed
- Clarified in the README that updating credentials from the Configure flow only updates the specific Mashov hub entry you opened and does not automatically sync other hubs

### Fixed
- Keep the last successful Mashov data when a generic authentication failure occurs and cached data is already available
- Added a clearer authentication notification with a Configure hint and Mashov login link for credential-related failures
- Added regression coverage for generic authentication failures that should keep cached data

## [1.0.6-beta.2] - 2026-04-18 (Pre-release)

### Added
- Added a privacy disclaimer to the README and GitHub bug-report template reminding reporters to redact personal and sensitive data before sharing logs, screenshots, or diagnostics

### Changed
- Updated the GitHub Actions workflow to newer action versions and expanded CI coverage to Python 3.11, 3.12, 3.13, and 3.14

### Fixed
- Added support for updating Mashov username and password directly from the integration Configure flow after a password-change-required error
- Added regression coverage for updating credentials through the options flow

## [1.0.6-beta.1] - 2026-04-18 (Pre-release)

### Fixed
- Added persistent Home Assistant issue notifications for Mashov authentication and refresh failures
- Added a dedicated password-change-required flow with a direct Mashov login link in the notification
- Keep the last successful Mashov data available when the service requires a password change before login

### Added
- Regression tests covering password-change detection, notification content, and cached-data fallback

## [1.0.5] - 2026-01-20

### Fixed
- **Authentication Race Condition**: Fixed a critical issue where concurrent requests (e.g., initial load) would trigger multiple parallel login attempts. (Fixes #4, #5)
- **Login Stabilization**: Added `asyncio.Lock` to ensure only one re-login attempt occurs at a time.
- **Session Validation**: Implemented smart session validation to prevent redundant re-logins if a valid session was established recently (debounce).
- **Log Spam**: Eliminated excessive "401 on ... attempting re-login..." warnings in logs.
- **Performance**: Improved update speed by ~4x (from ~13s to ~3s) by eliminating wasted requests and redundant re-authentications.

## [1.0.4] - 2025-10-27

### Fixed
- **Critical bug** in calendar.py - Fixed operator precedence that could cause crash when finding next holiday
- **Grades sensor** formatting - Added proper display formatting (by_date, by_subject, with average calculation)
- **Grades data cleaning** - Now removes redundant technical fields (gradingEventId, gradeTypeId, etc.)

### Changed
- Updated README with @aviadlevy credit for calendar contribution

## [1.0.3] - 2025-10-24

### Added
- **Grades sensor** - New sensor for student grades (`sensor.mashov_<student_id>_grades`)
  - Displays grade, grading event, teacher name, subject, grade type
  - Includes event date, grading period, and textual grades
  - Full integration with size-based limiting (14KB target)
- **Calendar entity** - Holidays calendar integration for Home Assistant calendar view
  - Contributed by @aviadlevy

## [1.0.2] - 2025-10-24

### Fixed
- **[Bug #2]** Fixed state attributes exceeding maximum size of 16384 bytes
  - Removed redundant technical fields (GUIDs, codes, IDs) from stored items, saving 15-45% space
  - Intelligent size-based limiting (14KB target with 2KB safety margin)
  - Binary search algorithm to find optimal item count that fits within size limit
  - User-configurable max items (10-500, default: 100) as starting point before size verification
  - All data remains available via `coordinator.data` for automations and templates
  - Added `total_items` and `stored_items` attributes to show full count vs. stored count
  - Added configuration option `max_items_in_attributes` in integration options

### Changed
- Optimized sensor attribute storage: removed technical fields (studentGuid, reporterGuid, eventCode, etc.)
- `items` attribute contains cleaned, size-optimized recent items (2x more items can fit now)
- Improved storage efficiency: Behavior 45%, Timetable 26%, Lessons 14% size reduction
- Logs info when size limit triggers automatic item count adjustment

## [1.0.1] - 2025-10-18

### Added
