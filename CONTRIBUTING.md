# Contributing to Mashov Integration

Thank you for your interest in contributing to the Mashov integration for Home Assistant! üéâ

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.11 or higher
- Home Assistant 2025.1.0 or higher
- Git
- Visual Studio Code (recommended)

### Development Setup

1. **Fork and clone the repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/NirBY/ha-mashov.git
   cd ha-mashov
   ```

2. **Install development dependencies**:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. **Install pre-commit hooks** (optional but recommended):
   ```bash
   pre-commit install
   ```

### Using VS Code Dev Container

The easiest way to get started is using VS Code with Dev Containers:

1. Install [VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) and the [Dev Containers extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-vscode-remote.remote-containers)
2. Open the repository in VS Code
3. Click "Reopen in Container" when prompted
4. All dependencies will be installed automatically

## Making Changes

### Code Style

We use [Ruff](https://docs.astral.sh/ruff/) for linting and formatting:

```bash
# Check for issues
ruff check .

# Format code
ruff format .
```

### Testing

All changes should include tests. We use [pytest](https://docs.pytest.org/) with [pytest-homeassistant-custom-component](https://github.com/MatthewFlamm/pytest-homeassistant-custom-component):

```bash
# Run all tests
pytest

# Run specific test file
pytest tests/test_sensor.py

# Run with coverage
pytest --cov=custom_components.mashov --cov-report=html
```

### Writing Tests

Place tests in the `tests/` directory:

```python
from pytest_homeassistant_custom_component.common import MockConfigEntry
from custom_components.mashov.const import DOMAIN

async def test_sensor_setup(hass):
    """Test sensor setup."""
    entry = MockConfigEntry(
        domain=DOMAIN,
        data={"username": "test", "password": "test"},
    )
    entry.add_to_hass(hass)
    
    await hass.config_entries.async_setup(entry.entry_id)
    await hass.async_block_till_done()
    
    assert hass.states.get("sensor.mashov_test_homework") is not None
```
